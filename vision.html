		<h2>Our Vision: First Principles </h2>
		<br>
		
		<section>At Wulesson, we are dedicated to helping students grasp the fundamental concepts of their chosen subjects and develop the ability to reason from first principles. We emphasize this approach because we believe it forms the foundation of true knowledge and equips students with a sustainable method for solving problems and navigating complexity over time. </section>
		
		<section>Recognizing that each student comes from a unique background and possesses varying levels of competence and needs, we understand that the challenge in learning often lies not in the precision of language, but in its clarity. When subjects are presented in a convoluted manner or when excessive information is provided all at once, students can struggle to master the material. This confusion can create a cycle of frustration; when students fail to understand the material and perform poorly in school, they may lose confidence and develop a lasting aversion to the subject.</section>

		<section>It is crucial to distinguish between merely knowing the name of a concept and truly understanding it. Our approach begins by assessing students' prior knowledge, refining their understanding, and building from that foundation. We then introduce topics that they have yet to encounter in school, which helps reinforce their understanding when these subjects are later presented by their teachers. This proactive strategy enables students to learn effectively, especially since they spend most of their time in school.</section>

		<section>Our ultimate goal is to empower students to grasp the underlying principles, gain the confidence they need, and develop their own problem-solving methods. We believe that students can achieve far more than they realize. By first mastering fundamental principles, they can approach subjects with greater ease and employ strategies to tackle challenges. Once this learning system is established, students can progress with confidence and independence. First Princeiples.</section>
