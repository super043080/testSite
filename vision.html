				<h2>Our Vision: First Principles </h2>
				<br>
				<p>In Wulesson, we focus on helping students to understand the fundamental concepts of the subject they are interested in and enabling them to reason from first principles. Heavy emphasis is paid on the notion of first principles, because not only do we believe it forms the ultimate building block of true knowledge, but we are convinced it will provide a sustainable approach for students to solve problems and deal with complexity in the long run. </p>
				<br>
				
				<p>Every student comes from different background and has varying levels of competence and needs. Undeniably, we are all unique in our own way. Quite often, the real problem in learning is not the use of precise language but clear language. When a subject is presented in a complicated way, especially when too much information is given all at once, students often struggle to learn the topic well. Sometimes, this will drive them into a vicious cycle of learning; because when they fail to understand and perform well at school, naturally they will lose confidence and hate the subject forever. </p>
				<br>
				<p>There is a difference between knowing the name of something and know something. Our initial approach is to assess studentâ€™s knowledge on previously learned concepts, quickly refine their understandings on them and build from there. Next, we will try to work on topics that they have never seen before but yet to learn at school. This has the benefit of strengthening their understandings when the topics are presented to them at school by their teachers. The ability to learn efficiently at school is by far the most powerful as they spend the most time there. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Our goal is to enable students to grasps the principles at work, gain the confidence they need, and have the ability to solve problems using their own methods. We believe our students can learn a lot more than they think they can. The key is to understand the fundamental principles first, tackle the subject with ease and then divide and conquer. Once the learning system is in place, they will run on autopilot. </p>
